# Denkey Car

Denkey Car is a Self-Driving RC car project that potentially consists of multiple RC cars backed by different sets of software to mimic distinct real world scenarios like highway, parking lot and off-road driving.

### Current State

A standard Donkey build. Run the default inference model on the Pi. No extra juice added yet.

### How to build a car

No rules! But if you want to have something to hold on to, the following builds are good starting point. All have parts list.

* [Donkey][0], $200
* [Berkeley BARC][1], min. $1000
* [MIT RACECAR][2], $4500
* [HyphaRos RACECAR][3], $600, low cost version of MIT RACECAR
* [GT AutoRally][4], $30000
